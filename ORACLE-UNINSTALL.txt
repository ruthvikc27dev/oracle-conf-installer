Automatically -

Run the deinstall script in the $ORACLE_HOME/deinstall folder. 
Select the default options unless you need to drop or delete schemas and listeners. 
Type y to continue. After the script finishes, remove the oracle folder.

Manually -

UNIX
Uninstalling all products from UNIX is a lot more consistent. If you do need to resort to a manual uninstall you should do something like:

Uninstall all Oracle components using the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI).
Stop any outstanding processes using the appropriate utilities.

$ dbshut $ORACLE_HOME
Alternatively you can kill them using the kill -9 pid command as the root user.
Delete the files and directories below the $ORACLE_HOME.

# cd $ORACLE_HOME
# rm -Rf *
With the exception of the product directory, delete directories below the $ORACLE_BASE.

# cd $ORACLE_BASE
# rm -Rf admin doc jre o*
Delete the "/etc/oratab" file. If using 9iAS delete the "/etc/emtab" file also.

# rm /etc/oratab /etc/emtab
If you are getting rid of the inventory, delete the "/u01/app/oraInventory" directory and "/etc/orainst.loc" file. If you were planning to keep the inventory location, you will need to edit the "/u01/app/oraInventory/ContentsXML/inventory.xml" to remove any removed homes.

# rm -Rf /u01/app/oraInventory /etc/orainst.loc
